{"name":"AGM","tagline":"Active Grammar-based Modeling","body":"#AGM -- Active Grammar-based Modeling\r\n\r\nA graph-grammar is a powerful tool that can be used to describe how a robot can build and modify its world model. Such information can be used for several purposes:\r\n* Generating plans to perceive the world\r\n* Generating plans to modify the world\r\n* Verifying world model modifications\r\n\r\nAGM is a tool used to develop graph-grammars and compile them to PDDL, which is the de facto standard for AI planning. This is a necessary step since, in order to achieve our goals, we will be using AI planners.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\nStill in development.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\nUse the GIT repository: git://github.com/ljmanso/AGM.git, e.g.:\r\n\r\n`git clone git://github.com/ljmanso/AGM.git`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nAn example AGM file can be found in the following link: [grammarGualzru.pddl](https://github.com/ljmanso/AGM/blob/master/examples/grammarGualzru.agm)\r\n###Visual editor\r\n`python AGMEditor.py`\r\n### Compiler\r\n`python agm2pddl <inputFile.agm> <outputFile.pddl>`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
